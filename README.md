With a robust background in healthcare and hospitality, I bring firsthand expertise in safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring strict compliance with regulations like HIPAA and PCI DSS. These experiences have honed my security mindset, fostering problem-solving, critical thinking, and effective communication.

My passion for risk assessment and automation extends beyond the professional realm; it's a personal commitment deeply rooted in core values such as accuracy, integrity, ethical conduct, fairness, and accountability. I am eager to transition into an entry-level cybersecurity analyst position, where I can apply my skills and dedication.

Understanding that cybersecurity is not just about data protection but also safeguarding real, human stories—especially for the young and vulnerable—I am resolutely committed to this field. By merging my diverse experiences with the dynamic demands of cybersecurity, I am motivated to ensure the internet remains a beacon of trust, safety, and ethical practice. I am excited about the prospect of bringing my unique skill set and passion for cybersecurity to a challenging new endeavor.
